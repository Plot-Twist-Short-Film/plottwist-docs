## **Why is important?**

When working inside DCCs, they work taking into account the current Project Path, this is the path
that will be used as the root path when working with relative paths.

To properly work in {{ project.name }} you need to setup the path where Artella downloads {{ project.name }} file locally.
You can manually setup the path but with this tool the path will be setup automatically.

***

## **How to use it**

Just left-click in top of the icon in {{ project.name }} Shelf.

!!! important
    {{ project.name }} Launcher automatically after launching the DCC, so you do not need to do it
    if you launch DCC using {{ project.name }} Launcher.
