# **Set Dressing Assets - Model Guide**

## **1. Handmade**

Before start every model you just need to think on that. There are no robots/machines on the
Medieval times. So, the perfection did not exist, all is handmade!
You need to feel on the object the work from the blacksmith, jeweller, wood cutter, etc.

## **2. Stylized**

Push the curves and go for crazy shapes as far as you can. Always keeping the good look and the
asset silhouette.

## **6. Proportions and Thickness**

We would like to keep the carton style. We could get that easy playing with this elements:

- **Proportions**: keep things a little big bigger than usual and push the scale contrast between objects.
- **Thickness**: Don't panic on it and played big.

## **7. Level of Detail**

Every little detail counts to make the asset looks better and different.
We need to put love on every prop and to make the set looks great!
